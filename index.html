            <p>I was born and raised in Canada. I've been tinkering with HTML, CSS and JS for a bit now, but I have
                no formal
                training. Would love to learn more about accessibility.

            <p>There is something so devastating about putting your all into a game for 6 hours and then losing right
                before
                the
                end.
                <small>Making things whether it's with a programming language or just HTML/CSS is an interesting way to
                    test
                    whether or not you have the drive to turn an idea into something tangible. It also gives someone a
                    huge
                    amount of power: CAN I make that weird thing I thought about a year ago that got me reading whatever
                    MDN
                    put in front of me? The answer is yes. But it will be hard.</small>
